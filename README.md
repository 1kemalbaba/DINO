# Pixel Dino Runner

*An addictive, pixel-art inspired endless runner game featuring a dino dodging obstacles and collecting coins.*

## Overview

Pixel Dino Runner is a browser-based endless runner game built with HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the classic Chrome Dino game, this project adds vibrant visuals, power-ups, a shop system, achievements, and dynamic weather effects to enhance the gameplay experience.
